            title: "Functional Examples from Category Theory",
            description: "Many concepts from Category Theory appear in functional programming languages, for example the functor, monoid, monad, and natural transformation. Although each of these concepts carries with it a distinct structure, each provides us with a way to unite the similarities in a piece of code, or even across and entire project, while still maintaining the crucial differences. Category Theory gives us the means to abstract over concepts such as types, type constructors, and operations, to name a few. In other words, Category Theory is the programmer's library of abstractions.<br><br>Functional languages, by their very nature, often direct the programmer to think abstractly in terms of categories. From a meta perspective, learning Category Theory helps us to become aware of the types of thoughts we have when we program in a functional language, versus say an imperative one. Programming in a different language inherently changes how we approach a problem, given the tools available in that language. By becoming aware of those differences in approach, we can make more informed choices in our programs.<br><br>In this talk we will discuss via example how we can understand various functional programs using a categorical approach. Additionally, we will discuss how we can use Category Theory to write cleaner and more maintainable code.",

The data is produced by applications using different technology stacks and comes from various sources, from web servers to sensors. How could you solve this problem? Enter RabbitMQ.<br/><br/>In this talk we are going to show how to build a system that can ingest data produced at separate geo located areas (think AWS and it's many regions) and replicate it to a central cluster where it can be further processed and analysed.<br/><br/>We will present an example of how to build a system like this one by using RabbitMQ Federation to replicate data across AWS Regions and RabbitMQ support for many protocols to produce/consume data.<br/><br/>To help with scalability we are going to show an interesting way to implement sharded queues with RabbitMQ by using the Consistent Hash Exchange.<br/><br/>If you want to learn what else has RabbitMQ to offer beyond simple messaging and queueing, then this is the talk for you. <h4>Talk objective:</h4> Our goal is to show that over the years RabbitMQ has gone way beyond a \"simple\" AMQP server to be able to have federated brokers, HA queues and support for many protocols and languages. <h4>Target Audience:</h4><ul><li>Developers interested in building a data ingestion platform that span many locations across the world.</li><li>Developers that have built these kind of solutions already but are interested in learning about alternatives.</li><li>Developers interested in RabbitMQ and Messaging in general.</li></ul>",

            description: "Willpower is the force that is between the brain activity (I want to do this or I need to do this) and the action itself (start coding). If there is not enough willpower, people find it difficult to start any activity (especially that involves concentration an decision making). The willpower is not endless (so-called muscle theory of willpower), it can be saved, it can be trained, there are approaches how to keep the willpower level high. To keep the willpower (and thus, productivity) on the high level, people should know and use different approaches that lay in the field on the social and cognitive science. There are a lot of evidences that SCRUM improves the developer’s productivity in terms of speed of development, code quality, and accuracy of design. Unfortunately mainly all recommendations from SCRUM coaches look like “believe me, if you do this, you will have better velocity”. Yes, it works. But why does it work? Sometimes SCRUM does not give such great results even when main elements are in place. The question “Why” and “What makes the difference” is here again. I will describe the model of relationship between the willpower related brain metabolism on very low level (specific amino acid cycle) and the SCRUM practices. I can prove that SCRUM addresses the productivity of the people’s brain using 3 different flows simultaneously. There are several tips that make these productivity flows working or not. You can make Agile productive, you can have non-productive Agile. I will show you where the difference is. Overall there are 10 productivity tips that can be put into 3 flows. As the outcome of this session, Agile coaches, and all people who can change the process (in fact that is any team member) will review their SCRUM: does the way they have it improve the productivity or they are losing all the power? The changes are cheap, the outcome can be huge.",

But once your project gets too large to hold entirely in your head, its elegance and simplicity starts to deteriorate - and that's where software psychology comes in. When we listen to the code, and the design, and the devops, we can hear the code calling for help and it can lead us to the right place to refactor, to redesign, and to robust-ize. A simple case of listening is mapping defect rates to modules and then refactor the modules with the worst rates. A more challenging case of listening is when a complex multi-service architecture'd app suffers a performance brown-out: what do you listen for and how do you counsel the code through it's difficulties?<br><br>I'll present a number of situations where listening to the code (or the design or the devops) is a good idea and various strategies (and tools) you can use to do so.

Building systems the way we're used to building them always seems to end in the inevitable death march towards exponential complexity. But once you stop to ask the right question- \"what's really causing all this complexity?\" - you realise the answers have really been staring you in the face all along. Debugging is only hard when you can't reason about your code. Concurrency is only hard when you can't predict the state of your code. Reusability is only hard when your components aren't naturally composable.<br><br>Fortunately, languages addressing these issues specifically are popping up all over the place. In many cases, it turns out we've had the solutions to our problems for a long time, we've just forgotten about them, or never really bothered to look. Let's take a moment to explore some of these languages, not as exercises in syntactic details, but looking at the inherent properties in their design that enable us to defy decades of OO tradition and write honest-to-Dijkstra bug free, fault tolerant software without even trying. After half a century in the wilderness, functional programming seems to finally be gaining some ground on the barbarians. Let's examine why.",

            description: "The techniques used to distribute software, scale it through concurrency or make it tolerant of latency are hobbled when, deep inside, the business logic is based on inappropriate assumptions of consistency. Yet it is common to do domain modeling and design business features heedless of these issues, and then patch things up after the fact with technical tricks. In DDD, we consider the the CAP tradeoffs to be central concerns of the design, and we incorporate into our domain models explicit assertions about the boundaries of consistency. When deployment reveals that additional or different CAP tradeoffs must be made, we go back to the root of the problem and modify the  domain model to reflect those tradeoffs explicitly. In this talk, I’ll discuss three DDD patterns that help us address CAP tradeoffs: Aggregates, Domain Events and Bounded Contexts.",

Yet writing even more tests of the same kind quickly runs into diminishing returns. I'll talk about new automated techniques that can dramatically improve your testing, letting you focus on what your code should do, rather than which cases should be tested--with plenty of war stories from the likes of Ericsson, Klarna and Volvo Cars, to show how these new techniques really enable us to nail the hard stuff.",

            description: "Around 6 years ago I started working with some tools that focused on software engineering collaboration and automation for operations. At the time products like CFEngine and Puppet were the two main tools promoting this new way of doing operations and sharing within operations and software development. A year later Chef was born and I was fortunate enough to join Opscode as the 9th employee as an evangelist preaching this disruptive form of collaboration and automation. At the time a majority of IT infrastructure was managed by what I called the \"Bob’s\" of the world. Bob’s scripts, Bob’s directories and Bob to death do us part. Trying to explain to Bob the benefits of collaboration and software engineering principles was a hard fought battle over the years. One of the compelling events that helped propel these ideas (what we now call Devops) was cloud computing. Fast forward to 2013 and these infrastructure automation and collaboration battles still exist but the battles are far less bloody. Now a new war is emerging in the Network operations and engineering space. The same argument for network operations adopting these principles has always been the same as system ops; however, now the new compelling event is the virtualization of the network. Software Defined Networks is a lot of buzz, but the reality is that many network operations and engineering groups are dealing with an influx of highly virtualized tooling like OpenVswitch, Openflow, OpenDaylight and NSX. Configuration tools are starting to get more sophisticated on these virtualized systems doing things like automated VLAN to Port mapping and basic system hardening. Chef and Puppet both have introduced primitives supporting platforms like Arista, Juniper and Cumulus Networks. Help me start the discussion of what Devops and the Network really mean.",

Daniel Kahneman, Nobel Prize Winner in Economic Sciences and psychologist verified in many cases, that forecasting of complex projects is impossible. Yet still, we keep losing time trying to do exactly that. Beyond Budgeting came empirically to the same findings and offers a concept for controlling corporations without budgets. Additionally Beyond Budgeting provides advice for controlling even long-term complex projects. Agile methodologies generally recommend developing a long-term plan on a coarse-grained level only and coming up with detailed short-term plans iteratively. In this talk I want to provide insights in the latest scientific research and show as well how Beyonddeudgeting and Agile principles can be combined so that even complex projects remain controllable.<h4>Learning objectives:</h4><ul><li>Understand why forecasting complex projects is impossible</li><li>Become acquainted with the core ideas of Beyond Budgeting</li><li>Understand how Beyond Budgeting can be applied on Agile projects</li></ul>",

            title: "The art of building tools - A language engineering perspective",
            description: "Developing software often requires using a number of tools and languages. In embedded software, for example, it is common to use C and its IDE, Matlab/Simulink, a number of custom XML files, a requirements management tool such as DOORS and possibly a UML tool and a variant management tool. The integration of such a zoo of tools is often a major source of (accidental) complexity in development projects.<br><br>Contrast that with the \"good old days\" when everything was text files and command line executables running on the unix shell. This approach had two important properties: the infrastructure was extremely generic (unix shell, pipes, text editors) and the actual contents were easily extensible and composable (new text file formats/languages and new command line tools); a productive environment for a given project or domain could easily be built from the generic infrastructure plus a few custom extensions.<br><br>In this talk I want to propose that creating (domain-specific) development environments based on language workbenches results in many of the same advantages that we all valued in the unix shell-world. A language workbench is an extremely generic infrastructure that is easily extensible with new languages. It is easy to create domain-specific development tools that can address different aspects of the system with suitable abstractions, but are nonetheless very well integrated in terms of syntax, semantics and tooling.<br><br>In the talk, I illustrate the approach with examples from two domains. One is mbeddr, an open source environment optimized for embedded software development. A second example is taken from the business/insurance domain.",

We know about principles and patterns at the small scale, such as SOLID, and the large scale, such as REST. We’re less familiar with the structures in the middle.<br><br>This talk is about design principles that we’ve learned help us develop mid-scale code structures that are easy to read and easy to change. At the lowest level, this means well-known patterns such as avoiding globals and following SOLID guidelines. At larger scales, this means assembling those SOLID objects to avoid hidden coupling so that the system as a whole is amenable to change.

            description: "On one hand the software development industry is pushing forward, reinventing the way that we build software, striving for agility and craftsmanship at every turn. On the other though, we're continually forgetting the good of the past and software teams are still failing on an alarmingly regular basis. Software architecture plays a pivotal role in the delivery of successful software yet it’s often neglected. Whether performed by one person or shared amongst the team, the software architecture role exists on even the most agile of teams yet the balance of up front and evolutionary thinking often reflects aspiration rather than reality. By steering away from big up front design and ivory tower architects, many teams now struggle to create a consistent, shared technical vision to work from. This can result in chaos, big balls of mud or software that still fails to meet its goals, despite continuous user involvement.<br><br>This talk will explore the importance of software architecture and the consequences of not thinking about it, before introducing some lightweight techniques to bring the essence of software architecture back into an agile environment. We'll look at creating a shared vision within the development team, effectively communicating that vision and managing technical risk. I'll also share the strategies that I've used to introduce these techniques into agile teams, even those that didn't think that they needed them. Expect collaboration, sketching and plenty of gamestorming.",

This leads to public guidelines how to avoid drowning in tons of persistence solutions all promising adventures in Alice wonderland. But you should take a step back and have a look at architectures that are able to handle big data, fast data streaming, analytics, semistructured / unstructured data and many more requirements. Decent out of the box solutions are still missing. And finally it's no secret that big data analytic questions are often severe in terms of scaling. But the shapes of the next generation systems in this space are visible and will be illustrated.",

In Babelsberg, constraints are assertions that the system tries to satisfy automatically.
